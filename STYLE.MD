# Style Guide for Six Feet Over <!-- omit in toc -->

> The original local dev environment uses VisualStudio Code with MarkdownLint and ESLint.

## Git

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:

## Markdown

Use [MarkdownLint](). There's a nice [plugin for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-markdown). Have a look at the [default style rules](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-lint/blob/master/doc/rules.md) and our own [.remarkrc](.remarkrc) for non-default configuration options.

These rules are selected for readability of source code compatibility with GitHub wiki features.

Please refrain from using HTML inside markdown files. Sometimes, using HTML is the only way to accomplish a Markdown feature, like including an image with a custom width attribute; in these scenarios, we make exceptions.

## HTML

## SASS

## JavaScript
